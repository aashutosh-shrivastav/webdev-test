          <p>Chicken curry is a dish originating from the Indian subcontinent.
             It is common in the Indian subcontinent, Southeast Asia, Great Britain
              as well as in the Caribbean (where it is usually referred to as curry chicken).
             A typical curry from the Indian subcontinent consists of chicken stewed in an onion-
             and tomato-based sauce, flavoured with ginger, garlic, tomato puree, chilli peppers 
             and a variety of spices, often including turmeric, cumin, coriander, cinnamon, cardamom
              and so on. Outside South Asia, curry chicken is often made with a pre-made 
              spice mixture known as curry powder.Chicken curry is a dish originating from the

        <h3 id="section2">Beef</h3>
        <p>Beef is the culinary name for meat from cattle, particularly skeletal muscle. Humans have been eating
           beef since prehistoric times.[1] Beef is a source of high-quality protein and nutrients.[2]
           Most beef skeletal muscle meat can be used as is by merely cutting into certain parts, such as roasts,
            short ribs or steak (filet mignon, sirloin steak, rump steak, rib steak, rib eye steak, hanger steak, 
            etc.), while other cuts are processed (corned beef or beef jerky). Trimmings, on the other hand, are 
            usually mixed with meat from older, leaner (therefore tougher) cattle, are ground, minced or used in
             sausages. The blood is used in some varieties called blood sausage. Other parts that are eaten include
              other muscles and offal, such as the oxtail, liver, tongue, tripe from the 
           reticulum or rumen, glands (particularly the pancreas and thymus, referred to as sweetbread), the heart
           , the brain (although forbidden where there is a danger of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, BSE, commonly 
           referred to as mad cow disease), the kidneys, and the tender testicles of the bull (known in the United
            States as calf fries, prairie oysters, or Rocky Mountain oysters). Some intestines are cooked and eaten
             as is,[3] but are more often cleaned and used as natural sausage casings. The bones are used for making
              beef stock. Meat from younger cows (calves) is called veal.
           Beef from steers and heifers is similar.[4] Depending on economics, the number of heifers kept for breeding
            varies. The meat from older bulls, because it is usually tougher, is frequently used for mince (known as ground
             beef in the United States). Cattle raised for beef may be allowed to roam free on grasslands, or may be 
             confined at some stage in pens as part of a large feeding operation called a feedlot (or concentrated
             animal feeding operation), where they are usually fed a ration of grain, protein, roughage and a vitamin
             /mineral preblend.Beef production has a high environmental impact per gram of protein.</p>

        <h3 id="section3">Sushi</h3>
        <p>Sushi is traditionally made with medium-grain white rice, though it can be prepared with brown rice or short-grain rice. It is very often prepared with seafood, such as squid, eel, yellowtail, salmon, tuna or imitation crab meat. Many types of sushi are vegetarian. It is often served with pickled ginger (gari), wasabi, and soy sauce. Daikon radish or pickled daikon (takuan) are popular garnishes for the dish.
           Sushi is sometimes confused with sashimi, a related dish in Japanese cuisine that consists of thinly sliced raw fish, or occasionally meat, and an optional serving of rice.
           The increasing popularity of sushi around the world has resulted in variations typically found in the Western world, but rarely in Japan. A notable exception to this is the use of salmon, which was introduced by a Norwegian businessman tasked with helping the Norwegian salmon industry in the 1980s.[36][37][35] Such creations to suit the Western palate were initially fueled by the invention of the California roll (a norimaki with crab (later, imitation crab), cucumber, and avocado). A wide variety of popular rolls (norimaki and uramaki) has evolved since. Norway roll is another 
           variant of uramakizushi filled with tamago (omelette), imitation crab and cucumber, rolled with shiso leaf and nori, topped with slices of Norwegian salmon, garnished with lemon and mayonnaise. </p>
